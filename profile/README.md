# Welcome to the official GitHub of the John-Lab

We are the John Lab, a research group led by [Professor Cédric John](https://www.john-lab.org/lab_member/head-of-lab/dr-cedric-john/) and hosted in the [Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/) at Queen Mary University of London. At DERI, Professor John leads the [Data Science for the Environment and Sustainability Research Platform](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/research/research-platform---data-science-for-the-environment-and-sustainability-/), one of four key research directions for the institute. Before joining DERI, the group was based for nearly 16 years in the [Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/).

Our research approach blends machine learning and AI with cutting edge field and experimental methods in Earth and Planetary Sciences. The [Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/) is the centre of digital, data science, and AI research at Queen Mary and it underpins the university’s vision for its research [Strategy 2030](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/strategy-2030/). For us, DERI is the perfect home for an interdisciplinary team working on scientific machine learning applied to environmental and Earth Science problems.

Here you will find original or forked version of the codes we developped, including references to cite if you decide to use our code.
